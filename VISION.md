```

- **99.99% uptime** — Reliability is non-negotiable
- **Zero-configuration deployment** — From zero to production in under 5 minutes
- **Sub-10ms latency** — Real-time performance for all connections
- **Global infrastructure** — Multi-region support out of the box

---

## Non-Negotiables

- **Reliability first** — It must work, always
- **Simple to use** — Complexity hidden behind clean APIs
- **Performance by default** — Speed is a feature, not an optimization
- **Transparent monitoring** — Full visibility into network health
